I've had some extra time this week. I made a quick and dirty way to automatically plot nodes I ban from this site. This has been done before and the code is public, I'll probably check out those examples next week to compare. I added an extra action to Fail2ban to append each IP to a text file. I have an hourly cronjob generating a new plot and throwing it into html/images/. Part of it calls on this Rscript:

``` r
  library("rgeolocate")
  library("stringr")
  library("rworldmap")

  ipVector <- strsplit(readLines("banned.txt"), '\n')
  list <- ip_api(ipVector, delay = TRUE)
  newmap <- getMap(resolution = "li")

  png(file = 'plot.png', width=992, height=553, res=45)

  plot(newmap)
  points(list$longitude, list$latitude, col = "red", pch=10)
  dev.off()
```
<!-- more -->

There is room to improve the quality and presentation of these - display settings are normally taken care of by RStudio, via a script it's all manual. There are other libraries available for plotting world maps out there, but they require a lot more time investment to get working how I want. The generated image:

<img src=/images/plot.png>

This nano instance had some issues compiling the dependencies for the libraries I used due to RAM limitations. I worked around this by creating another volume, attached/formatted/mounted as a swap partition, and it worked. AWS is kinda cool.
